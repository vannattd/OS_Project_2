  This application generates processes and allocates them in memory using 3 methods:
 * First Fit
 * Best Fit
 * Worst Fit
  
  
  This is displayed using Windows Forms and was written in C#
  
  
  During runtime you can see the processes generated and allocated and deallocated as their
    runtime is completed.
